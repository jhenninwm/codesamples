# Code Samples
downloader_FINAL.py is a script for downloading satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 using the Google Earth Engine API. This was used during my senior year honors thesis project.

tiff_to_ascii.py converts GeoTiff files to ASCII raster file format. This was written for a course called Spatial Data Discovery.

*It is important to note that neither script should run successfully. downloader_FINAL.py and tiff_to_ascii.py each require input data (coordinate data and GeoTiff files, respectively) in order to execute.*
